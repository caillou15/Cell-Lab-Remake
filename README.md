# Cell-Lab-Remake
A PC version created with permission from the original developer.
The simulation is done in Unity, with scripts written in C#.
At some point I hope to get it on Steam Greenlight, but that's a *long* way off for now.

## Interested in contributing?
Let me know, I'll be happy to add you.
I can use
 - Developers (preferably C#, as that's what all the scripts are in now)
 - Graphics People (I am really weak in that area)
 - Ideas People (For coming up with new features)
 - Cell Lab people
     - If you have studied how Cell Lab works (on Android) and want to help make sure I get the mechanics right, I'd apprecate the extra eyes.

## Interested in playing
 - If you have unity, you can always download the project and build it yourself.
 - For those who don't have unity, I'll try to keep a somewhat updated version available in the Builds folder (just run the executable from in that folder)

### Please give your feedback and constructive criticism
 - I am new to the whole game making thing, so if you see specific points that should be added, adjusted, redone, or eliminated, let me know.
